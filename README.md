# ImplementAI Project: Duckiebots meet AI  
------------------------------------------
This project is a comprehensive project connecting AI techniques, especially natual language understanding and visiual feature recongnition, with an interestiong ros robot platform Duckiebot. The Duckiebot can understand commands from human, use  objects recongnition and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods to response command.

The projects is developed based on Nuance MIX API(http://bit.ly/mix-hack), Duckietown project (https://github.com/duckietown/Software), YOLO-ROS project(https://github.com/leggedrobotics/darknet_ros) and ORB-SLAM2 project (https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2). Thanks a lot to these open source projects.
